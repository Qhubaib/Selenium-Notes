-->mvn test(it will execute only test in project & it wont create .jar files)
-->mvn package -DskipTests(it will skip TCs nd check for build success)
-->mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true(this will also skip TCs But for this we have give the property under properties in pom.xml file   <maven.test.skip>false</maven.test.skip>(you have to give true here) to skip the TCs ==> Later the it as false(Otherwise it will skip the TCs always)
